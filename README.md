Hello! Attached are files for the Intro to CSS Final Assignment. I have tried to upload all the necessary photos, etc., all of which are open source.

There is a "skip to main" feature that is hidden and will show up on the screen if you tab through the page.

If you have any trouble viewing the page, please try to copy and paste the files to your own replit or github account. Please note that this may mmake it difficult to view the images.

Thanks!
