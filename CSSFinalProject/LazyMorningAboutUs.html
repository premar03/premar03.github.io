    <h1>Lazy Morning's History</h1>
    <p>
       Established in 2010, we have been proud to serve the Youtown community for well over a decade. We began with a desire to bring fresh, affordable, and delicious breakfast options to our neighbors, and we have since expanded our operations to serve even more of our wonderful guests. We believe there's nothing better than a Lazy Morning in today's hectic world, and we hope you'll agree!
